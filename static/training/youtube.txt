I love how when Rhett was talking about being a top bunk man, Cameron was just sitting there trying to decide if he was making an innuendo or a tall joke lmao |1
Is there any food Rhett wouldn’t eat and say he loves |1
same when he makes jokes lol |1
food creativity strikes 😆 |1
Link after messing up: "I did not do that on purpose." Rhett: "Yeah I know you did it because you're Link." |1

Evan's exact response to hearing "aluminum extrusions" 🤣👏 |1
As a musician, I will say that you should definitely do as you said you might - add taller rubber feet to the bottom and wrap leather around the wooden dowels at the bottom so the finish doesn't scratch on the wood. Also, small straps to your neck holders so that if you do happen to bump your stand or any guitar in it, they wont accidentally fall out. It will also allow you to pick the stand up and move everything together for cleaning or re-arranging purposes. Though, taking out the guitars is still recommended. Ha ha! |1
